Create and Consume OAI-ORE Documents
====================================

d1_pyore is a DataONE python library for working with OAI-ORE_ documents which 
are used by DataONE Member Nodes to describe data packages.

Two commandline scripts ``ore2txt`` and ``pids2ore`` are included to produce a
more human readable representation of an OAI-ORE document and to create an OAI-
ORE document from a list if identifiers respectively.
